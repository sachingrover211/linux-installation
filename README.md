# README

This repository talks about installing languages, databases and softwares that one might need on Linux. 

This was made for my personal help to do few things on linux whenever I install a fresh version. I am still learning but so that I do not spiral back to zero and learn the next steps I am writing what problems I faced while installating JAVA, PHP etc, and how to successfully install all this. 

## File Structure
[settings.md](settings.md) has the personal setting changes that I did for installations. For eg: I use dual boot with Windows. So how to automatically mount the hard drives on load.
[installations.md](installations.md) this contains instructions and my own learnings for installations. This is a quick reference file while installing stuff. 
Settings folder - this folder contains all the setting files. [Settings/README](README) in the folder will tell you all the setting files that are there.

## Working on 
Creating scripts that will do all those steps for installating those languages automatically.
