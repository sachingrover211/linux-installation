* [vimrc](vimrc) contains the settings for customizing vim. It changes the default colorscheme to desert (which I find better suited for development). It also creates intelligent formatting for code and sets tab size to 4 rather than 8 (default value). Add this to `~/.vim` folder to setup the changes.
* [eclipse.desktop](Eclipse desktop) file is the file I use for eclipse desktop. You can either use the command to install using command `$ desktop-file-install eclipse.desktop` \*.

\* means the command requires root access.
